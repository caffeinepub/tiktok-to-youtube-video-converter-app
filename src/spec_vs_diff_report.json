  "summary": "REQ-10 is largely implemented: ListingSection now includes a one-click \"Copy submission details\" action that formats app name/description/live URL (using window.location.origin) and uses a shared clipboard helper with success state (\"Copied!\") and console error logging on failure. However, the diff excerpt does not show any rendered, visible inline error UI when copying fails.",

      "requirement": "If clipboard copy fails, the UI shows a visible non-crashing error state (e.g., inline message).",
      "reason": "ListingSection.tsx sets copyError state and logs an error, but the provided diff excerpt does not show any JSX that conditionally renders an error message/state based on copyError. Because the file is truncated, this may exist below the truncation, but it is not evidenced in the shown diff.",
