  "summary": "Core SPA flow, URL validation, preset selection UI, themed styling, and a conversion/history UX are implemented. However, the actual conversion/export does not produce an MP4 (it generates a JPEG), the results preview is an image rather than an in-browser video player, TikTok source retrieval is not implemented (explicitly described as a demo), and history deletion is only available for local entries (not synced/backend entries).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Initiate retrieval of the source TikTok video for conversion after URL submission.",
      "reason": "The conversion logic explicitly states it is a demo and does not retrieve TikTok video content; it generates a canvas image instead.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Export a downloadable YouTube-ready MP4 file (download completes successfully).",
      "reason": "The export hook creates a JPEG blob (canvas.toBlob with 'image/jpeg') and the filename ends with .jpg; comments indicate MP4 is not produced.",

    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Results screen previews the converted video in-browser (playable preview).",
      "reason": "The results preview renders an <img> element and describes it as a 'converted video frame' rather than using a <video> player.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/features/results/ResultsScreen.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Allow users to delete individual history entries from the UI.",
      "reason": "Deletion UI appears only for non-backend entries; entries with ids starting with 'backend-' display 'Synced' and do not show delete actions. Backend actor also does not expose a delete method.",
