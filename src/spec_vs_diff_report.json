  "summary": "Implemented new “Share & List” UI with a listing instructions section and share utilities, plus centralized app metadata and share-intent URL builders. Some REQ-9 consistency requirements and parts of REQ-8 (footer icon href replacements/new-tab behavior) are not verifiable from the provided truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Replace the footer social icons’ placeholder (#) hrefs with real share-intent URLs that share the current app URL, opening in a new tab.",
      "reason": "App.tsx is truncated before the footer/social icon render code. While share-intent builders are imported, the diff summary does not include the actual anchor/link href updates (removal of href=\"#\"), target=\"_blank\", rel=\"noopener noreferrer\", or confirmation that the current app URL is prefilled.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Ensure the app name and a short one-sentence description are displayed consistently in the header/hero/footer and reused in the listing section without conflicting copy.",
      "reason": "Header title text appears hardcoded as “TikTok → YouTube” rather than using appName (“TikTok to YouTube Converter”), and the hero imports appName but does not use it. Footer display of app name/description is not shown in the provided diff snippet.",
