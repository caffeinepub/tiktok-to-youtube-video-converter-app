# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add an App Market listing guide and sharing utilities so users can easily list and distribute the TikTok → YouTube Converter app.

**Planned changes:**
- Add an in-app “Caffeine App Market listing” section with step-by-step English instructions and a prominent CTA that opens https://caffeine.ai/ in a new tab (noopener noreferrer).
- Ensure the listing section is reachable from the main app UI without requiring authentication.
- Add sharing utilities that display the current app URL and provide a one-click “Copy link” action with visible success feedback.
- Update footer social icon links to use real share-intent URLs (opening in a new tab) that share the current app URL, with correct URL-encoding and no social API integrations.
- Standardize app metadata (app name + one-sentence description) so it’s consistently shown in header/hero/footer and reused in the new listing section.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can access a dedicated page/section explaining how to list the app on Caffeine (with a direct link to caffeine.ai), and can easily copy/share the live app URL via updated footer share links.
